Before we start the migration, verify that you can connect to the target database.

Use the PostgreSQL client installed in the bastion host to connect to the target postgres database via the target VPC endpoint:
  psql -h target_vpc_endpoint -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres

Create the target database by running the following statement:
  CREATE DATABASE demo_db;
